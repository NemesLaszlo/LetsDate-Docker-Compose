### The Repository pattern

Repositories are classes or components that encapsulate the logic required to access data sources. They centralize common data access functionality, providing better maintainability and decoupling the infrastructure or technology used to access databases from the domain model layer. If you use an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) like Entity Framework, the code that must be implemented is simplified, thanks to LINQ and strong typing. This lets you focus on the data persistence logic rather than on data access plumbing.

As long as we are getting the correct results, we are not concerned with how the application code is structured, what the various layers defined are, how they interact, how they pass the required data among them and so on and in most of the cases, we use the database context directly inside the controllers. This creates tight coupling between the controller and the data access layer and if we look closely into this type of code, it violates the Single Responsibility Principle as well as Open close principle. Any change related to the data-access layer can break the controller code. In such a case, our code structure has the following layers:

![First code structure](images/1.jpg)

As seen from the preceding structure, layer 1 is using the database context directly and connects with the SQL Server. This is where the repository pattern can be implemented, to separate the layers. Our purpose will be to separate the controller and the data access layer (database context) using an intermediate layer, in other words repository layer, for communication between the two. So our code structure now changes to the following:

### Unit Of Work

It acts as the mediator between the MVC controller and the generic repository, to do all the database transactions in a single go.

(For Example: The advantage of using this class is the fact that when we are doing multiple operations in one single controller method, we will be committing all the changes in the database by calling the SaveChanges only once and that is through the Unit Of Work instance. )

### SignalR

ASP.NET SignalR is a library for ASP.NET developers that makes it incredibly simple to add real-time web functionality to your applications. What is "real-time web" functionality? It's the ability to have your server-side code push content to the connected clients as it happens, in real-time.

( In this app we are using SignalR to handle the "Online Now status" for users and also to handle the messenger functionalities. )
